# README

In this project we built a Deep Learning pipeline to detect a number of facial key points on pictures with human faces.

We trained a Convolutional Neural Network with around 5000 images of celebrated/known people from all across the globe with facial key points labelled.
The images were extracted from videos in Youtube.
